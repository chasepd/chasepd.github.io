It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why; to a security-minded person, saying &amp;ldquo;I can make this system do something other than what it was meant to do!&amp;rdquo; sounds an awful lot like a security vulnerability. It gets even scarier when you add AI into that system, since the inner workings of AI models is often not understood as well as more traditional systems.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging AI Tools for Security Review and Penetration Testing</title><link>https://chasepd.github.io/posts/ai-tools-for-code-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chasepd.github.io/posts/ai-tools-for-code-review/</guid><description>Introduction AI coding tools have fundamentally changed how developers write code, but their impact on security engineering workflows is still being explored. As someone who spends significant time reviewing code for vulnerabilities and conducting whitebox penetration tests, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that tools like Cursor can significantly enhance both the speed and thoroughness of security assessments.
This post covers practical strategies for integrating AI coding assistants into security code review and whitebox penetration testing workflows, based on real-world experience using these tools in production environments.</description></item></channel></rss>
