This is part two of a two part series on Windows enumeration. For the first part, see https://chasepd.github.io/posts/tools-for-windows-enum/.
Impacket: Deep Protocol Interaction While NetExec provides broad coverage, Impacket offers deep, protocol-specific interaction capabilities. Think of Impacket as a specialized toolkit where each tool is designed for precise, targeted enumeration of specific Windows services and protocols.</description></item><item><title>Enumerating Windows Machines For Fun And Legal Profit Part 1</title><link>https://chasepd.github.io/posts/tools-for-windows-enum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chasepd.github.io/posts/tools-for-windows-enum/</guid><description>This should probably go without saying, but this should only be used on machines you have authorization to test.

Don&amp;rsquo;t be stupid. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re conducting penetration testing or participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, one of the most critical phases is enumeration. Think of enumeration as digital reconnaissance—you&amp;rsquo;re gathering intelligence about your target to understand its structure, services, and potential vulnerabilities before attempting any exploitation.</description></item><item><title>Hack the Box - UnderPass (Easy) Walkthrough</title><link>https://chasepd.github.io/posts/htb-underpass-walkthrough/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chasepd.github.io/posts/htb-underpass-walkthrough/</guid><description>Box Info Box Name: Underpass
