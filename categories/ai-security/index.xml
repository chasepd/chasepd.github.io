It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why; to a security-minded person, saying &amp;ldquo;I can make this system do something other than what it was meant to do!&amp;rdquo; sounds an awful lot like a security vulnerability. It gets even scarier when you add AI into that system, since the inner workings of AI models are often not understood as well as more traditional systems.</description></item></channel></rss>
