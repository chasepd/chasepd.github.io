               Somehow, you’ve found the digital home of Chase Davies, or chasepd.
This site is a personal blog and project space for sharing thoughts, tutorials, and creative work. I write Hack The Box writeups when I feel so inclined, and otherwise ramble about topics in the hopes that it might be of help to someone at some point. Or because I feel like writing about them.
Not that I talk about my employer much (or at all) on here, but my views don&amp;rsquo;t represent my employer etc etc.
